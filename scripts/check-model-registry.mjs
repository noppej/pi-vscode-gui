// ── Second question: is what's INSTALLED actually current? ──────────────────
//
// The check above only proves the registry matches the installed pi-ai. Both can be stale
// together, and were: the bundled catalog sat at 0.84.1 while 0.84.4 was published, so the Rust
// picker was missing deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp while the TypeScript one — which reads the SDK
// live — had it. This gate passed the whole time, because internal consistency was all it asked.
//
// The dependency range is `^0.84.1`, so a lockfile refresh picks up 0.84.4 on its own and never
// touches package.json — meaning Dependabot has nothing to raise a PR about, and CI's
// --frozen-lockfile keeps the old resolution indefinitely. Nothing in the pipeline was ever
// going to notice.
//
// This matters more than an ordinary stale dependency because the catalog carries PRICING and
// model availability: stale here means quoting rates that no longer exist and hiding models the
// user is paying for.
//
// Network-tolerant by design: a build must not fail because npm is unreachable. Unreachable is a
// warning; a definite answer showing drift is fatal.
// Fatal ONLY where a stale catalog actually reaches users: the publish jobs set
// PI_REGISTRY_CURRENCY_STRICT=1. Everywhere else this warns.
//
// It was fatal everywhere, and that was wrong in a way worth naming. The check depends on what
// UPSTREAM publishes, so a green pipeline turns red with no change to this repo — it took out an
// unrelated Dependabot PR (@types/node, eslint, zod) the day pi-ai 0.85.1 shipped. Three things
// follow from that:
//
//   - The blast radius was wrong. A stale catalog is a defect in the artifact we SHIP, not a
//     reason to block a lint-config bump.
//   - It blocks the people who would fix it, by failing every branch at once.
//   - It would have been routed around. The first time this red-walls a release day, someone
//     sets PI_SKIP_REGISTRY_CURRENCY=1 in CI permanently and the signal is gone for good — worse
//     than the warning it replaced.
//
// The consistency check above stays fatal everywhere: it is deterministic, caused only by our
// own commits (a pi-ai bump without regenerating), and fixable by the person who tripped it.
